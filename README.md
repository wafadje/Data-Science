## Push & Pull

**1. Go to your local working directory**
```
cd ~/code/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```
**2. Check if your work is properly saved**
```
git status
```
- If your `git status` is not clean save your work and push it to your Github repository
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin master
```
**3. Download any update (lecture and exercises) from Vivadata Github repository**
```
git pull upstream master -X ours
```
