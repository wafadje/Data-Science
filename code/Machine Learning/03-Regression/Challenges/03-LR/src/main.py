"""
Remember how we implemented k-NN algorithm from scratch a few days ago?

In this challenge, the goal is quite similar: implement the Linear Regression model from scratch.

And when we say from scratch, this time it is really from scratch wink

OK.., two small hints:

    You should again, implement a class with the proper methods init, fit, predict
    You can recode the gradient descent from scratch also... but maybe you will prefer to use the function linalg.lstsq from scipy library smirk
    Separately, compute a function computing the sum of residual squares for your predictions

Once you are done, test your new class on diabetes dataset from scikit-learn library. Compare your results with the LinearRegression from scikit-learn.

Good luck padawan üßô‚Äç"""
