II. Allez les bleus
    Write a SQL query that returns the team_id of France team fr.
    > sqlite> select id as team_id from teams where code = "FRA";
	team_id
	131
    Based on France team_id write a query that returns the number of matches played by France team.
    sqlite> select count() from games where (team1_id = 131 or team2_id = 131);
	count()
	5
    Write a SQL query that returns person_id and goals_scored (the number of scored goals) of all French players who scored a goal. Order the results by descending goals_scored.
    sqlite> select person_id, count(score1) as goals_scored
   ...> where team_id = 131
   ...> group by score1
   ...> order by score1 DESC;
	person_id|goals_scored
	28|2
	134|2
	23|3
	108|5
	99|2
	sqlite> 
    Write a SQL query that returns the same result as before but with the player name instead of the person_id. Which French player scored the most? Is the data clean?
    sqlite> select p.name, count(score1)
   ...> from persons p
   ...> join goals g
   ...> ;
	name|count(score1)
	Pogba|22378
    Write a SQL query that returns the minute at which Benjamin Pavard scored his "Demi-vol√©e" goal.
III. Best strikers
    Write a SQL query that returns the name, the team name and the number of goals_scored of the 3 players who scored the most goals (excluding own goals)in the competition.
IV. Stats per country
    Write a SQL query that returns all teams that played with the fields nb_games_played, nb_games_win, nb_games_lost, nb_games_draw. Order the results by nb_games_played descending, nb_games_win descending, nb_games_draw descending, and team_name ascending.
        flashlight Hint: Go step-by-step when constructing your SQL query. At the look of the games table, construct first a table that answers the question for team playing "at home" - then for team playing "outside" - then combine both.
    Write a query that returns those results for Asian team(s) that played more than 3 games.
    Write a query that returns those results for African team(s) that lost all their game.
    [BONUS] Write a query that returns those those results for all countries plus the fields nb_goals_scored, nb_scores_collected.
