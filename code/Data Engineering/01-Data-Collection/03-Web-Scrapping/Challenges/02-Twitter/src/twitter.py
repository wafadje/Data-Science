Guidelines

Write a Python script to get the number of followers of a given Twitter account.

Your program should prompt the user for an account name and deal with wrong answers.

Your code must be written in src/twitter.py.
Bonus

Want something more tricky? Try to scrap a given number of tweets of a given Twitter account.

Store your tweets in output/tweets.json
